        I a m Chima Modesty Chinedum. I a m a web developer. I create and develop websites. I have an Associate Degree from Brigham Young University, Idaho. Also, I have over two years of experience. Do you want an online presence of your organization or business? Do you want your website to perform certain tasks, such as processing orders, taking credit or debit card payments, interact with your customers, online sales and purchases? That’s what I do. I make requested web applications feasible. If you own or operate a business which hasn't taken step into the online world, here is your opportunity.

      <h2 class="web-developer-h">Web developer.</h2>
    <p class="web-developer-p">A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design which has been created by either a client or a design team  and turns it into a website.
They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code, using a variety of languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.
As you can imagine, this can take a lot of time and effort and requires an intricate understanding of various programming languages and how they are used. Different types of developers specialize in different areas, which means that large web projects are usually a collaboration between several different developers.  </p>
      
      <h2 class="developer-type-h">Types of Web Developers.</h2>
      <p class="developer-type-p">For many outside the field of web development, it is not commonly known that there are several different types of web developers that exist. Within the developer world, we literally have dozens of titles that distinguish us from the rest based on our skillset and what we can create with it. Overall, web developers can be summed up into three general types with each one fulfilling a unique need in the process of creating websites for the whole world to see.</p>
  
      
        <h2 class="frontend-h">Frontend Developer.</h2>
      <p class="frontend-p">The front-end developer is responsible for creating the look, feel, and interactive components of a website. They are often mistaken as the only role in web development as well as confused with the role of a web designer. How text, images, and colors are displayed on a website when you view them on a phone, tablet, or computer is what the front-end developer creates. Ever see a button change color when you hover over it or a popup appear when you click on something on a page? That’s what the front-end developer creates. They make sure everything you see is organized, aesthetically pleasing, and functional.

To accomplish all this, the front-end developer generally writes in (but not limited to) the following programming languages:

HTML, 
CSS,
JavaScript,
JQuery,
React,
VueJS,
AngularJS.</p>
        <h2 class="backend-h">Backend Developer.</h2>
      <p class="backend-p">The back-end developer has one of the most crucial roles in web development. They create and maintain what’s under the hood to keep your website running and functioning properly. A back-end developer writes what is called server-side code to make sure data flows back and forth from a website’s front-end (what the user sees and interacts with) to the back-end (the server, database etc.). The best example of this would be an online store. Prices and product images are stored on a database hosted on a server. When it comes time to update prices or initiate an automated holiday sale, product information and prices are updated on the database which then displays on the website. When you checkout and process a transaction, all that works because the back-end developer madeit so. They write the code that makes all those easy to use (most of the time) functions possible.</p>

            <div class="fullstack">
      <h2>Fullstack Developer.</h2>
      <p>The full-stack developer is a unique developer type as they can program and work on both front-end and back-end parts of a website. They can literally create an entire functioning, dynamic website themselves (if they choose) as they understand both ends of web development. Full-stack developers tend to have prowess in coding in multiple programming languages and their knowledge and experience tend to be a mile-wide. Because of this, they generally work well with both the front-end and back-end developer during the development process.</p>
        <p>
          While they understand and can do the job of both front-end and back-end developers, many full-stack developers typically do not have mastery in either role. Some usually are better at either front or back-end development. There are full-stack developers that have mastery over both ends of development but they are rare and hard to come by. The diverse knowledge of a full-stack developer helps speed up the web development process and troubleshoot any problems that may occur on the front or back-end of a site.</p>
